**Location-based photo spreading application. Infect others with your photos, just by snapping.**

- Manipulate [Apple Maps API](https://developer.apple.com/maps/) with [PHP](http://php.net/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as backend.
- Implemented a monitoring system about the range and the epidemic of photos.
- People can post and explore photos that can only be found in where they are, And extend the photo's range.
- Without continuously extending, the photo'll be exterminated.
- Expired on [<s>iTunes App Store</s>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pueue/id913591280).
