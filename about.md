Yes. I know my English is terrible.

I started this blog at December 1st, 2014. But I started to post on this blog in English at January 12th, 2016.

This blog is for improving my English and recording my programming stuffs.

There isn't the comment feature in this blog. You can give me feedback on anything at my twitter([@pueuepueue](http://twitter.com/pueuepueue)).
